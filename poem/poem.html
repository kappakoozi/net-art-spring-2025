    <h1>Peach eyes and blue skies</h1>
    I'll be with you on your ride
    It's on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=Q385MQrfuxI&t=0s">moonlight</a>
    How many <b>songs</b> I write
    <p>You'll be my sunlight</p>
    How could I not rely
    On you, peach eyes?
    <ol>You're mine, as soon as I watch your eyes
    Couldn't find fear on my damn mind
    </ol>Oh, my, I'm heading into you
    Would you don't mind?&nbsp;(Would you don't mind?)
    I'm talking to you
    Oh, I'm talking you
    My life is so jerky, yeah
    So, would you let me
    To hide inside your eyes
    Your <em>peach Eyes</em>
    <br>
    Peach eyes and blue skies
    <ul>I'll be with you on your ride
    It's on the moonlight
    How many songs I write
    You'll be my sunlight
    How could I not rely
    </ul>On you, peach eyes?
    The countless days I've been without you
    (You were the one I need)
    You know, besides
    I won't find nobody to give my, ayy, whole life with you
    Oh, you
    <hr>
    Peach eyes and blue skies
    Oh, it's on the moonlight
    You'll be my sunlight
    Peach eyes
    Peach eyes and blue skies
    I'll be with you on your ride
    It's on the moonlight
    How many songs I write
    You'll be my sunlight
    How could I not rely
    On you, peach eyes?
    Peach eyes and blue skies
    Oh, it's on the moonlight
    You'll be my sunlight
    How could I not rely
    On you, peach eyes?
