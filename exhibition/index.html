  <h1>A world of glitched art</h1>
  <h2>Curated by Kevin Pham</h2>
  <p>This exhibition, "A world of glitched art," brings together three pieces of net art that manipulate, reinterpret, and disrupt the everyday experience of browsing the internet. These works include digital distortion, perception, and a theme in the aspects of their work. In addition, these works  add visual and structural expectations. These artists also encourage their viewers to reflect on the fragility and artificiality of online spaces. Also, this exhibition has clickable links, where you are able to visit the artist’s work on the actual website that they display their work on. Overall, this exhibition displays the varied amount of net arts that all have their own unique style.</p>
